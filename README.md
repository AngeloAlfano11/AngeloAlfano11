As my bio says, I'm an EX chemistry student that tried to follow this scientific branch but failed because it needs to learnt by heart and i'm not good at that. The only good thing that i lerned was opening my minds to the science and because using a computer was always a part of my life, i decied to study IT.
Currently I'm a student at the University of Milan, studying Computer Science for New Media Communications and i really love learning and using a new Programming language even if i only know at the time of writing this GO and Java.

Enough formalism. 
My passion is gaming with friends online and building Roleplay campain with different type of systems like D&D or my favourite and less known Farsight (which is, in the end, based on D&D).
With this README i hope I'm making my first steps in the GitHub community and i hope i can learn more of everything in it.
